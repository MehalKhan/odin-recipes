# odin-recipes
This is the firrst HtMl project mehals bitchass is doing.

Pretty much in this HTML project, the assignment is to make a recipes website without the CSS and Java script but only HTML. 

Here we are to make Odin recipe's with 3 links to different recipes with a description of what the recipe is, unordered list of the ingredients, and ordered list on how the recipe is made. That's it!
